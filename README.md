### About me

I'm an Informatics Engineer with a deep passion for Web and Mobile Applications Development. During my journey in University, I learned how to tackle a project with perseverence and determination, to look for more than one solution to any problem and the meaning of teamwork. I'm an organised, passionate, determined and hard-worker person, who's always looking to tackle new challenges and learn new things.
